<p>This section shows some of the statistical properties of the code base, as generated by <a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/pkgstats">the <code>pkgstats</code> package</a>. By default, only outlier values are shown, for which the “Limits” slider below can be used to reduce statistical properties to only those lying in the lower or upper percentiles of the specified value. The table uses the following abbreviations:</p>
<ul>
<li>“LOC” for <em>Lines-of-Code</em></li>

<p>By default, the following charts of both models and metrics only show categories for which the repository is an outlier, defined as lying in the lower or upper 10% of all repositories. Note that these outlier proportions depend on distributions of values measured across all repositories, and will generally not correspond values beyond the limits of [10, 90]% on the scale shown. For example, values for metrics of models may be very concentrated around 0.5 with only a very few extreme values. The lower 10% of values may, for example, be all those below a value of 0.4. Clicking on the following button will toggle to display all values.</p>
<p>The model names shown on the bars are hyperlinked; clicking on any will take you to the model definitions on the <a href="https://chaoss.community/kbtopic/all-metrics-models/">CHAOSS Models pages</a>.</p>
